// what is the diffence between dynamic and static array ?

// the new operator allocates the memory on heap and returns the adress of that newly allocated memory

// when the new keyword is called for an object, first the memory is allocated
// and then the object is initialized

// a dynamic array is free sizeable, the static array has fixed size

// to access anything from the heap, we must have a pointer
